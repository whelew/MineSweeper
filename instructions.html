            <li>Minesweeper is a game where mines are hidden in a grid of tiles.
                The aim of the game is to reveal all safe tiles!
            </li>
            <li>To reveal a tile left click it!</li>
            <li>Safe tiles will have a number on them from 1 - 8, this number tells you 
                how many mines are around that tile!
            </li>
            <li>A mine can be touching a tile horizontally, vertically or diagonally.</li>
            <li>Sometimes a tile will have no number inside, this means that it is touching no mines.
                This will also reveal safe tiles around it until it hits a numbered tile.
            </li>
            <li>Right click on your mouse to place a flag on a tile you think contains a mine!</li>
            <li>The amount of flags you start with tells you how many mines there are in the game!</li>
            <li>If you hit a mine, you lose the game!!!</li>
            <li>To win the game you simply need to reveal every safe tile!!!</li>
            <li>You score is based off of the timer and how long you take to complete the level!</li>
            <li>Good Luck and have Fun!</li>
        </ul>
